chars - a Rails application showing the number of keystrokes by finger


read_a_zip.rb is a command line utility to read a zip file, select
out the files to be processed, and total up the characters in that project.

The rails application makes use of the character counts and mappings of the 
characters to the fingers that would normally type those characters.

Highcharts is being used to dynamically create graphs of data.  The graph
on the project list page shows the total of all projects.  Each projects
detail page shows the same graph for that project only.
